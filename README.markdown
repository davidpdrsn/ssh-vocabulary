SSH vocabulary

Install the required things. Make sure to do this before hacking on it

```
bundle install
```

Run the server (for testing locally)

```
bundle exec rails server
```

Deploy to production (after having made a bunch of commits and stuff)

```
git push heroku master
```

To edit the files look inside the public folder
